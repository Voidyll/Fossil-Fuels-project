      What is Solar Energy?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Solar energy is turning the radiant light and heat generated from the sun into energy we can use, such as electricity and heating. The most common way is through solar panels, which while. You can power whole houses with only enough panels to cover the roof. However this form has a few downsides, solar panels are fairly expensive and are essentially useless at night.

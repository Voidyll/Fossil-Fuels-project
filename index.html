    Fossil fuels have long played a massive role in technological advancement. Its popularity started to rise back in the 1880s when coal was first burned to generate electricity. Ever since then its energy producing capabilities have been a leading cause to humanities advancement. However, despite fossil fuels being a great start to industrialization, it's far from perfect.<br><br>
    
    Fossil fuels have been the primary source of energy in the United States for over a century now. Presently, rougly 81% of energy comes from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are finite, and relying on them so much for so long has drastically depleted our reserves of them (stanford.edu).

    As of now, at the current rate we use these fuels, we will be completely out of them in approximately 53 years. This would spell disaster for our current economy due to how heavily we rely on them. This furter pushes the need to switch completely over to renewable energy soon.<br>

      What is renewable energy?
    </h3>
    
    <p class="text">
  
    Renewable energy is any type of energy that doesn't deplete its source when used. For example, wind energy, hydro energy, solar energy, and geothermal energy (to learn more about each of these types of energies, use the tabs at the top of the screen). Now why are these energies better than fosil fuels? <br> <br>
    
    First of all, the process of making these forms of energies could open up thousands to tens of thousands of new jobs. This rise in employment could improve the economic state, and help bring people back into the flow of the economy. If the total percentage of renewable energy were to double, then global domestic product would increase by as much as 1.1%, or $1,300,000,000,000 (renewableenergymagazine.com).<br><br>
    
    Next, all of these types of energies have little to no carbon emissions, meaning cleaner air everywhere. As of now, roughly 37 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions a year (carbonbrief) are being released into the atmosphere due to burning fossil fuels, this damages the ozone layer that protects us from radiation from the sun and makes the air we breath more harmful. Renewable energy has relatively zero of these emissions (nap.edu).<br> <br>
    
    Finally, renewables are, well, renewable. They dont rely on a finite resource. For example, solar energy uses the energy from light and radiation of the sun to turn into electricity. This is considered renewable as the sun's life span is so large that we dont have to worry about running out of solar energy for billions of years.<br><br>
    
    In conclusion, the need to switch to an alternative energy source is larger than ever. And renewable energies are the ones that could make that change. And although fossil fuels have been wonderful for us in the past, it's time we embrace the future of energy

      What is Hydro Energy?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Hydro energy is the process of using the flowing of water from a higher place to a lower place to turn a turbine which in turn charges a battery. This process takes advantage of gravity, which makes it extremely useful as gravity is a universal force of attraction between matter. This means as long as theres matter, theres a way to get energy out of them moving towards each other, allowing us nearly infinite energy if managed properly. On top of that the process produces zero harmful gasses or pollution.

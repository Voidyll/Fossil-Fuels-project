    <h3>
      What is Wind Energy?
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Wind energy takes advantage of the natural weather and wind patters oh earth. Using the wind to turn massive turbines which generate electricity. These turbines have become extremely popular recently due to how relatively cheap and easy they are to make. The only downsides is these turbines are often much noisier than you would be led to believe, and if extremely fast winds pass through them they can break or fall over.
